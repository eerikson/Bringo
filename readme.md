Welcome to bringo.

The first phase here is familiarzing ourselves with Websockets; so we will begin by creating a chat client for our app.
From there, we can add features through this basic system.

To build: `npm start` (the heroku app will run this) This will do an initial asset & TSC build and start the server.
To watch for changes: `npm run dev` This doesn't run the server, but builds and spawns a watch process.
